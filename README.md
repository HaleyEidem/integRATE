# integRATE
integRATE is a desirability function-based framework for the integration of data.

Our method allows for the application of desirability functions to diverse, heterogeneous omics data and facilitates integration of results and ranking of candidate genes for further analysis. By applying desirability functions to key variables across many relevant studies, our method transforms all data to a common [0, 1] desirability scale. Previously heterogeneous data can then be straightforwardly integrated both within and between studies using an arithmetic mean, resulting in overall desirability scores for each gene that represent the weight of evidence from omics data for its involvement in the pathology of interest.
