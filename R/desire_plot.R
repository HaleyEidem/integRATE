#' Plot desirability scores
#'
#' This function plots genes with the top overall desirability scores and,
#' optionally, their desirability scores from all integrated data.
#'
#' @details By plotting genes with the top overall desirability scores as well
#' as their individual desirability scores from integrated data, the user can
#' visualize not only the most desirable candidates, but also where the
#' desirability signal is coming from within their data.
#' @param x A data matrix where the first column is overall desirability and
#' additional columns are desirability scores from individual tests.
#' @return Returns a geom_point plot generated by ggplot.
#' @export
