Description: Our method allows for the application of desirability functions to
    diverse, heterogeneous -omics data and facilitates integration of results.
    Our method applies a desirability function to each key variable in all
    relevant studies based on whether the most desirabile values are the lowest,
    highest, or most extreme in each variable's distribution, thus transforming
    all data to a common [0, 1] desirability scale. In addition to the
    identification of studies and variables to integrate, our method also
    requires the user to input cut points where each desirability function
    changes as well as the scale controling how quickly the function changes
    between the maximum and minimum desirability. Data within studies can
    be straightforwardly combined using a geometric mean, resulting in a
    desirability score for each gene in the study containing information from
    all variables. Eventually, these study-based desirability scores can also be
    combined using a geometric mean to calculate a combined overall
    desirability score for each gene across all integrated studies. This score
    represents the weight of evidence from -omics data for its involvement in
    the pathology of interest and serves as a metric with which to rank
    candidate genes for future functional analysis.
