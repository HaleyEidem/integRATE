Description: Our method allows for the application of desirability functions to
    diverse, heterogeneous -omics data and facilitates integration of results
    and ranking of candidate genes for further analysis. By applying
    desirability functions to key variables across many relevant studies, our
    method transforms all data to a common [0, 1] desirability scale. Previously
    heterogeneous data can then be straightforwardly integrated both within and
    between studies using a geometric mean, resulting in overall desirability
    scores for each gene that represent the weight of evidence from -omics data
    for its involvement in the pathology of interest.
